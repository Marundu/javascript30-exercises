I have been struggling to learn JavaScript and I think it is because I was attempting to grasp it irrespective of its applications. That is, I was learning JavaScript by itself without relating it to what I wanted to achieve and partly out of a sense of FOMO.  

Now I want to get back to learning JS, one) to get a better understanding of the web and how it works, and two) because learning, despite its attendant frustrations, is fun. It keeps me out of mischief and accords me a greater appreciation for software and its development process and also an appreciation of profanity, the commonest language in programming.
