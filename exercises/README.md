I have been struggling to learn JavaScript and I think it is because I was attempting to grasp it irrespective of its application. That is, I was learning JavaScript by itself without relating it to what I wanted to achieve.  

Now I want to get back to learning JS, one) to get a better understanding of the web and how it works, and two) because learning, despite its attendant frustrations, if fun. It keeps me out of mischief.
